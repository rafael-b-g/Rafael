        <h2>A little about me.</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Rafael. I am <span id="age"></span> and live in Brasília, Brazil. I love
            technology. As far
            as I remember,
            I've always been deeply curious and fascinated by computers and electronics. This curiosity led me to a
            passion for STEM subjects. However, I'm not just a techie person; I also love design. Making beautiful,
            intuitive, and functional interfaces is one of my favorite things (btw, I'm a big fan of Bauhaus). The
            intersection of arts and technology is where things get interesting, and that's where I am. </p>

        <h2>Tech.</h2>
        <p>These are some of the technologies that I use and I'm familiar with:</p>

        <h2>Some stuff I wanna do.</h2>
        <p>In the near future, I intend to go to college (in the US) to study computer science (probably). I also want
            to take a design course (Learn UI Design), but my budget is limited, so maybe next year. In the long term, I
            want to work with technology and design, in a company of my own. Working for myself would allow me to bring
            my ideas to life and project my ideals into the world. I want this freedom. My main goal is to bring
            development to my country, Brazil. I want to incentivize the growth of R&D, improve education, and make real
            changes in the lives of Brazilian people.<br>Maybe even change the world. Who knows…</p>
